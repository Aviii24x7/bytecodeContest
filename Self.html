        <pre>The Art Of Knowing Yourself</pre>
    </header>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            Aristotle, a Greek philosopher, once said “Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.” Aristotle
            always stressed on logic. He always went by logical thinking. He wanted people to grasp life and reality
            structures by their own self.But the question is how do people really know themselves?
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowing your own true self is knowing and accepting different parts of your body, your attitude, your body
            size, your behavior, your heart, and everything else about you. This just mainly focuses on YOU. A person
            knows oneself only when they are comfortable in being who they really are.

        <em> answering this is quite hard.</em>They are comfortable with letting other people know who they genuinely
        are and don’t have to put on the “pretending mask”. This pretending mask is actually very dangerous for a
        person. It’s not a human being or an animal or an object but it’s an invisible cover that people wear it on
        themself and become what society and their surroundings want them to be and restrict themselves from being who
        they truly are.

        <p>
            I’ve seen so many people being just a very different version when they are with “some kind of people” and
            exactly after minutes when they are with someone else their attitude, their behavior change so rapidly. This
            is exactly what a pretending mask is. They’ll change themselves according to the people they meet avoiding
            their true selves. And obviously, when you are not being YOU, it’ll be harmful to you later in your life.
            I’ve met so many people who are just so addicted to this that they at times become so rude to other ones.
            You need to accept who you are because you are meant to be in this world and that you have a purpose and
            that’s what makes you unique and rare.

            Just have a look at this one. There was a girl whose name was Fabiola. She was a pretty girl with curly
            black hair and loved using her imagination to do different things. She was good at sports and other
            activities but she never felt it right. Like I mean if a person is so damn perfect why will they not feel
            good about it? But she never did. Because she never realized who she truly was. Then one day by chance she
            entered an auditorium in her school and there was a program going on of LGBTQ+community. When she saw all of
            that, it was a very great feeling for her. She felt as if everything around her was just so right in spite
            of the fact that she was just standing and doing nothing. It was at that moment when she realized that she
            is a lesbian. She felt so proud of herself that as if it was a great achievement for her and honestly it was
            and that made her unique. When people got to know about her, they were not very supportive but she didn’t
            give a damn about it because she loved herself the way she was and that’s the only thing that matters.

            There are people who are just not good in so many things or they think that they don’t know anything and are
            dumb or don’t have a certain way to behave and feel useless. But hear me out, you DON’T have to feel that
            way because you are unique and rare and that you need to love yourself and be the way that makes YOU happy.
            It’s your life and you should live the way you want to be. You are YOU so behave like that and be what makes
            you cheerful and good about yourself.
            <br> If people appreciates you for who you are but you are not feeling right with who you are, You really
            need to Find THE REAL YOU!
