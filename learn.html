        So how can you know who you are and what you ought to do in life? Here are the six steps you need to take in
        order to know your true self:
    </p>
    <header id="SubHead">
        <pre>1. Be quiet.</pre>
    </header>
    <br>
    <p>
        You cannot and will not be able to discover yourself until you take the time to be still. Many people don’t know
        themselves because any sort of silence scares them; it’s too uncomfortable to be alone with every flaw staring
        back at them. But it isn’t until you get alone, evaluate yourself and are completely truthful with yourself that
        you will actually be able to see every facet of your life—the good and the bad. Be quiet and discover your true
        self.
    </p>
    <header id="SubHead">
        <pre>2. Realize who you truly are, not who you want to be.</pre>
    </header>
    <p>
        I know you already have a set idea of who you desperately want to be, but it might not be who you were designed
        to be. When you know who you are, you will finally see where you and your specific gifts fit into the bigger
        picture.

        And although there are many points along your journey to help you discover yourself, the best way to begin is to
        take a personality test and the StrengthsFinder test. (If it’s been five or more years since you’ve completed
        either of these, take them again.) No, these self-evaluations aren’t perfect, but they do pinpoint your top
        areas of strengths, so you can focus on the change you were meant to bring into the world.
    </p>
    <header id="SubHead">
        <pre>3. Find what you are good at (and not good at).</pre>
    </header>
    <p>
        This might be the most difficult step in discovering who you truly are, but it’s a necessary one. Sure, it takes
        trial and error to find what you’re good at, and no, I don’t want you to give up before you’ve had more than
        enough attempts, but knowing when to quit is a gift that everyone needs to learn.

        Quit when you’ve put in ample time and your efforts aren’t giving back. What is ample time? Only you can decide
        that. But when you quit correctly, it isn’t giving up, it’s making room for something better. When your actions
        do nothing but drain you—rather than produce more passion and increase your drive to do more—that’s a good sign
        it is time to focus elsewhere. Your strengths will show you who you are.
    </p>
    <header id="SubHead">
        <pre>4. Find what you are passionate about.</pre>
    </header>
    <p>
        Following passion of any kind is a good thing, and you need to pay attention when it comes because it shows an
        area of life that you need to pay more attention to. If we’re talking about following your passion in work, it’s
        a good thing. And if we’re talking about having more passion for life, it’s a good thing. Focus more on passion;
        understand yourself in better ways, and you’ll make a bigger impact. Passion produces effort and continuous
        effort produces results, which produces a deeper discovery of your true self.
